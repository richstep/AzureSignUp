4.	Fill in the "get to know you" form. Use the same email address that you did in the previous step.

5.	Fill in the "create your user ID" form. The domain name you choose isn’t too important so don’t be upset if YourCompany. com is already taken. If it is do something like YourCompanyInc or YourCompanyLLC.
